Canonical ordering, used for faster Dictionary lookups, are built by sorting according to the increasing index of each element. This approach elminates confusions created by building words. Evidence that per word spelling is not significant in recognition suggests there is utility here.

Each tree of meaning can select synonyms based on the speaker's context and various conditions, such as with find (generic) vs hunt (serious) vs quest (motivation).

The examples illustrate two different uses of 'be' as an auxiliary. In the first 'be' is part of the progressive aspect, used with '-ing' on the verb, and in the second it is part of the passive, as indicated by the perfect participle of a transitive verb, existence, of the form 'there copula noun' [There is a cat], location, of the form 'noun copula place-phrs' [The cat is on the mat], [The cat is here].</td></tr>

<td class="Sy">#11</td><td>Romanization</td><td>Romanization for Pronounciation</td><td>The optimal way to transcribe PyDru into a Romanized Alphabet-using language, like English, is to capitalize the first letter of the consonant and lower case the second consonant, if it exists, and vowel. Although there are cases where the inverse might have distinguishing value, the convention is to eliminate scope rapidly, thus going from 256 to 8 ( consonant recognizer ) KrzHe more efficient than 256 to 32 ( vowel recognizer ). All capitals fails due to single consonants making it harder to distinguish. Consider the example series JiJeJo vs jIjEjO, or HriHruHra vs hrIhrUhrA. Then consider the example series JiHriHiTi vs jIhrIhItI.  Clearly there are always preferences, but given the above costs and the metric</td></tr>

<td class="Sy">#14</td><td>HryDru__MyGo</td><td>Legible Direction</td><td>PyDru should be written in any desired direction since reading vertically rotated text (the first example) is not much slower than horizontal, as reported in this academic research (Laarnia, Simolaa, Kojoa & Ristob, 2007). They claim English readers are practiced at this to begin with, when they read from collections of upright items, like books and video tapes. They measured the speed of reading vertical text, and reported that it is not much slower. Benny Skogberg wrote about the fact that we read words as a whole as shapes or a letter collection. Another psychological phenomenon called mental rotation (Sheprad & Metzler, 1992) showed we can rotate images in our imagination at a constant rotational velocity. By inference, we can stipulate that people can read vertically rotated words in an efficient manner, though not as that of horizontal oriented ones.</td></tr>

<td class="Sy">#15</td><td>HryDru__FyGo</td><td>Search Direction</td><td>PyDru is better arrayed as vertical lists for searching as they are much easier to scan than horizontal lists, because all items are aligned to the same line. When you're looking for an item, you don't need to read the entire word since you can quickly scan the first glyphs and get directly to the item you need. See how much less time it takes you to locate items beginning with P on vertical vs a horizontal list. Even when the sorting is horizontal, users will often scan it vertically, because of the Gestalt law of Proximity, unless the horizontal spacing within the rows is much smaller than the vertical spacing between the rows. </td></tr>

<td class="Sy">#16</td><td>Wa_Anisotropy</td><td>PyDru Shape Choices</td><td>A study by Oliver Morin at Max Planck Institute used classic visual cognition research to predict three aspects of the shape of letters. (1) Vertical and horizontal lines (as in E, H, L, etc.), which are easier to recognize, discriminate, and memorize, should be more frequent than oblique lines (as in X, Z, W, etc.); (2) Obliques and cardinals should not mix: Letters consisting exclusively of cardinal lines (like E,H,F) or exclusively oblique lines (as in W and X) should occur more frequently than those combining the two (as in K, A and Z); (3) Vertical symmetry is widespread in nature and is recognized more quickly by humans than horizontal symmetry, so letters are more likely to be vertically symmetrical (as in M, A, W, U, etc.) rather than horizontally symmetrical (as in K, D, E, etc.). The existence of all three characteristics--cardinal domination, separation of oblique and cardinal lines, and overrepresentation of vertical versus horizontal symmetry--were confirmed by two independent evaluators in most of the scripts in the study, which includes rare scripts that developed independently of Western influences.</td></tr>
