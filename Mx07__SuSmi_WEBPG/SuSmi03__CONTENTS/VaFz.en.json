		, "Ne04_Hx01__Ka01_vsg": "COMPUTER_IS_BICYCLE_FOR_OUR_MINDS: I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts. And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. — Steve Jobs (1980)"


		, "Ne04_Hx00__Nz02_vsg": "FIVE_QUESTIONS:"
		, "Ne04_Hx01__Ka02_vsg": "- Trust: Is wantware real/viable? Does it do what is claimed.\n- Scope: Can it scale globally? Evidence it can reach intended clients as desired solutions.\n- Success: wantware Competition, IP-Protection and Market Lockout? Industry interest and value to existing stakeholders.\n- Risk: How ready and stable are we today and our roadmap? Timing and resources required to meet milestones.\n- Value: Is it worth it? Does empowering all humans to have personalized dialogs that create machine behaviors, shareable solutions, carry a global market value? Does it affect AI, Automation, and near-term economics?"

It handles the user specified needs by exposing all of its potential capabilities ( 'what it can do' ) and current activities ( 'why and what its doing now' ) to an interactive dialog in the user's language and style.\n\nJUUL_QUOTE: I realized that the change we were seeking would not come from waiting for people or governments to do “the right thing” with respect to communities, sustainability, and justice. It required too much “zoom out” thinking— seeing the bigger picture, when most people were just trying to get by and raise their families. I saw creating wantware as means of opening up at least one sector of the economy to all people with an idea. To enable users to innovate in their own areas of expertise, solve problems from their unique perspective, own and control those creations, and monetize, trade, or give those creations in a truly free economic ecosystem. The image I always came back to was from the end of the 80’s movie, Solarbabies. One group controls all the water and thus has all the power. The solar babies release the water in such a way that it cannot be easily captured again. The power structure falls.\n\nWHAT: wantware is a Meta-Computer as it functions to talk 'About' computing and reconfigure itself for all its task needs by regenerating its machine instructions and transforming its data structures & streams towards performance or wattage or other optimization goals.
