# POWER OUR PEOPLE

WANTWARE_PONDER: We just may genuinely empower many if not most of our people to make the world a better place with more solutions and more minds on each problem than in history.

WANTWARE_PITCH: Economic win for making all our evolving tech 'Monetizable' by the global population. From if-then-that-instructions to A.I. pattern recognition or faking to tweaking details like art or writing styles, its simple to live show the value of non-programmers making tech solutions. Everyone who uses tech has frustrations of access that dissapear here. Goal is to empower all people with tech to solve all the problems they face. Not removing programmers, just expanding the pool of who can change the behavior of tech from programmers to everyone. ( note: in the 80s, we had the home computer revolution, but it wasn't mostly about people programming, it was copying programs from magazines or cassettes and maybe editing something small. this is about your words equals your digital-agent's behavior ).
